# SiteExtract

Extract information from other sites and publish to wordpress.

This is a simple project which is meant to just use a few /node.js/ libraries to scan a site and publish content highlights from it to a /WordPress/ installation.

This is a provided as an example on how to use these modules, rather than meant to encourage people to steal online content. Please be mindful when using it for your own /WordPress/ site.
